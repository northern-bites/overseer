Overseer is the NBites ground detection server. Based on work done by
Piyush Khandelwal (piyushk), piyushk@cs.utexas.edu


See attached source code licensing for more details.
Right now this is just meant to be a submodule in nbites, so it cannot be

Hopefully it will become its autonomous package in the future.
